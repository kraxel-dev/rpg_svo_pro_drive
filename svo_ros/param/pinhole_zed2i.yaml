# Instructions:
# - Most of the time you will just need to change the basic parameters.
# - The parameters in this file are set for the resolution of 752x480.
#   If you use a different resolution, change the parameters for
#   each module according to the comments.

# Pipeline type
pipeline_is_stereo: False

# Feature and keyframe number
# To run faster, you can decrease `max_fts` and `max_n_kfs`, for example:
# max_fts: 120
# max_n_kfs: 5
#TODO:
max_fts: 120
max_n_kfs: 9

# Map scale when initialized (not used for stereo)
# Increase if the initial scene depth is larger

# do not take a new keyframe
# You can lower this value for more keyframes\

# When taking a new keyframe,
# we can already update the newly initialized seeds with old keyframes.
# This is important for forward looking case.

# Default affine compensation parameters
# Most of the parameters are set to false for the consideration of processing time.
# If you observe bad tracking because of light/expousre change,
# enable the following parameters.
