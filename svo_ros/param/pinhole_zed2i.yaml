# Instructions:
# - Most of the time you will just need to change the basic parameters.
# - The parameters in this file are set for the resolution of 752x480.
#   If you use a different resolution, change the parameters for
#   each module according to the comments.

##### Basic parameters #####
############################

# Pipeline type
pipeline_is_stereo: False

# Feature and keyframe number
# To run faster, you can decrease `max_fts` and `max_n_kfs`, for example:
# max_fts: 120
# max_n_kfs: 5
#NOTE:
max_fts: 120
max_n_kfs: 30

# Map scale when initialized (not used for stereo)
# Increase if the initial scene depth is larger
map_scale: 1.5

# Initial rotation
T_world_imuinit/qx: 0
T_world_imuinit/qy: 0
T_world_imuinit/qz: 0
T_world_imuinit/qw: 1

# Keyframe selection
kfselect_criterion: FORWARD    # alterntive: DOWNLOOKING
# The following kfselect_* ONLY affects FORWARD
# If the number of features: >upper, no keyframe; <lower, take keyframe
kfselect_numkfs_upper_thresh: 120
kfselect_numkfs_lower_thresh: 70
# If the current frame is within the following range of any visible keyframes,
# do not take a new keyframe.
# You can lower these values for more keyframes
kfselect_min_dist_metric: 0.1
kfselect_min_angle: 20
# If the median disparity from the last keyframe is smaller,
# do not take a new keyframe
# You can lower this value for more keyframes\
# NOTE: forward motion reduce
kfselect_min_disparity: 24
# When taking a new keyframe,
# we can already update the newly initialized seeds with old keyframes.
# This is important for forward looking case.
update_seeds_with_old_keyframes: True  

# Default affine compensation parameters
# Most of the parameters are set to false for the consideration of processing time.
# If you observe bad tracking because of light/expousre change,
# enable the following parameters.
# NOTE:
img_align_est_illumination_gain: false
img_align_est_illumination_offset: false
depth_filter_affine_est_offset: true
depth_filter_affine_est_gain: false
reprojector_affine_est_offset: true

###### Tuning for each module ##########
########################################
# Initialization
# For a higher resolution, increase the value accordingly.
#NOTE: increase for resolution
# ---------- disparity: important to turn down for forward car motion! Otherwise initialization will only work in curves!
init_min_disparity: 12  # NOTE: mark as most important
init_min_features: 50
automatic_reinitialization: true

# Feature Detection
#NOTE: increase for resolution
grid_size: 26 # Larger for larger images, for every cell you have max one feature.
#NOTE: increase for resolution
n_pyr_levels: 5 # Increase for larger images (image align max minus one)
detector_threshold_primary: 10 # Fast detector threshold
detector_threshold_secondary: 200 # Edgelet detector threshold

# Image Alignment
#NOTE: increase for resolution
img_align_max_level: 5 # Increase this level by one if the image is double the width and height (752x480).
img_align_min_level: 2

# Reprojection
use_async_reprojectors: False # For stereo, change it to True for multithreading.
reprojector_max_n_kfs: 7 # Local map size. Larger is computationally more intensive. More reduces drift.
scan_epi_unit_sphere: False # for wide angle lens, set it to True.

# Pose Optimization
# NOTE:
poseoptim_thresh: 4.0 # Reprojection outlier threshold (px), should be larger for larger images.
poseoptim_using_unit_sphere: False # For wide angle lens, set it to True

# Depth Filter
# How many times does the covariance need to decrease until a seed is considered converged.
# Increase to get more accurate points
# NOTE:
seed_convergence_sigma2_thresh: 220

# IMU
# Normally the prior should be 0 if not using IMU.

# KRAXEL EDIT: omitted here, hijacked further below for arbitraty motion prior

# KRAXEL EDIT:
# Toggle Motion Prior from arbitrary external pose tfs (For exmaple: wheel odometry or radar odometry).
# Keep in mind that this will hijack and break some of the IMU params so better use vision-only frontend with tf motion prior.
# If toggled, initialization REQUIRES external pose tfs to bootstrap the map with metric scale.  
# After succesfull initialization the visual front-end can run even without pose tf messages present.
use_motion_prior_from_tf : True  # Make sure use_imu is set to false if you toggle this
